# math481_seminar
Holds python code for my senior seminar project at Colgate for applied mathematics major. A network analysis project (NetworkX python package) that creates player value rankings for each NBA team based on the individual playerâ€™s combined contribution to each 5-man lineup that he participated in. With a more complete understanding of each players' impact on a lineup's performance, coaches can better tailor allocation of playing time and general managers can better target areas of the roster to improve upon.
